"James Dirago","As many have alluded to, customer service continues its rapid downhill descent. The people who answer the phone can't do anything except offer an apology and tell lies. Amazon is afraid to give you a long delivery date because they do not want to miss a sale or cause you to shop elsewhere. Instead they lie about the delivery date and every day they extend the delivery time. I see NO reason to have prime. Hardly anything arrives the following day. I despise buying foreign junk. Buying more products from Walmart. Will NOT renew Prime. Amazon does NOT care about its customers. Shameful.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 10, 2024"
"Gary Jones","It's often a case of my parcels being logged as ""handed to recipient"" when they dump it on the doorstep, ring the doorbell( if I'm lucky) and are gone before I can open the door. The last time it was ""left at or near back door"" when the photo shows it on the front step in full view of the road, my thieving traveller neighbours and the bus stop with the courier glimpsed as he got to his van. I'll have to stop shopping here before it costs me money.","Rated 2 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 10, 2024"

Black Friday I ordered a like-new condition 15 inch powered speaker with 20% discount on their used items. When speaker was delivered, I went outside the house to get it and i see this small package - received a completely different item. I complained and asked to send the right one and they said item was no longer available. i had to drive to a UPS location to return the wrong item.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: November 26, 2024"

For 2024, at least 30% of our orders ended up getting lost by Amazon and their so-called delivery drivers and had to be cancelled with a credit issued. Their customer service is useless and basically non-existent. Amazon opened a brand new Fulfillment Center in Tallahassee in September 2024 and their service has gone down hill ever since.

"Fred Finotti","Very disappointed. I ordered a camera that was over $1,000 and it said it would be delivered on December 10th. I know that sometimes there can be a delay in delivery by a day or two. My problem is that it was supposed to be delivered today and it not only wasn't delivered today it hasn't even been shipped and the only thing that is stated about the delivery is that I will be notified when it ships. It doesn't even give me a projected date on the shipping now. It also tells me that I cannot cancel it. Like I said I wouldn't mind at all and I would understand that was just a matter of my delivery date being set back a day or two but the fact that this hasn't even been shipped yet on the day that was actually projected to be delivered and I seem to have no recourse on this at all.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 10, 2024"

They don't even ring the doorbell to notify the recipient a parcel has arrived. I saw a kid jump out of a van and run to leave parcels outside and run back to the van...!! Today I had a notification that my item was delivered with the front of my door closed! Surprise surprise it's not there so I've had to raise a dispute with Amazon.

"Tara","I’m extremely disappointed with my account access experience. After being repeatedly locked out of my account, I have spent months attempting to rectify this situation to no avail. Today, I spent two hours before work on the phone with customer service and one hour after returning home to merely access what Amazon bills me for. What adds to my frustration is that I pay for my annual service and Amazon Music, which I am currently locked out of. However, Amazon continues to bill me for services they know I cannot access. It's unacceptable to be charged for something I can't use. To make matters worse, customer service has been of zero help. Each time I reached out for assistance, I received vague responses that didn’t address my concerns. It felt like I was going in circles without real guidance on resolving the issue. I am appalled and outraged by the recurring lockouts, lack of support, and billing practices.

Just this morning, I returned the monitor because it was clearly a previous return; the stand was impossible to assemble due to misaligned holes. It’s unbelievable. I’ve had much better experiences with Best Buy and regret not making the switch sooner. While Amazon works for smaller items, I now highly recommend Best Buy for significant purchases. Their product quality is superior, and their customer service and return process are much more dependable.

This is completely unacceptable. When I reached out for help, the customer service I received was the worst I have ever encountered. They insist that I need to file a police report for a situation that is clearly a civil matter! The police won't accept a report because this has nothing to do with them. It's outrageous that Amazon cannot handle their orders properly. Additionally, every response I've received from their agents has been nothing but copy-pasted replies that do not address my issue at all. This is beyond frustrating. I truly believe that Amazon has really bad business practices, especially when it comes to return items. When you return an item, oftentimes they don't even look to make sure the item is in the box or that the correct item is in the box. They also usually don't even look to make sure that the item in the box is in a condition to sell again! If they receive a return that is for a reason other than that it doesn't work then they just add it back to their stock and it gets shipped out to the next customer.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 06, 2024"

"Kelvin Foulkes","I personally feel extremely let down by Amazon of late. I've spent a good amount of money with them in the past two years. My accounts with them have always been impeccable, but whilst on holiday, one of my cards expired without be realising for one of three of Amazon Payment Plans I had in place. One payment was late by a day and a half by the time I had noticed. So not only did I pay the late payment and updated my account with the new card, I completely paid off all three in one go. Since that one late payment, I no longer have the Amazon payment plans as I've been measured by their AI and deemed unworthy. By all accounts, there is no option for human intervention when it comes to this so not only am I being judged by a computer now, it would seem that this computer is above all staff members including Management who rudely cut me off during a chat and confirmed that he has no control. Is this a sign of the future where all humans are judged by zeros and ones with no intervention by a friendly face who can see reason?

To make matters worse, their representatives consistently fail to understand even the most basic instructions, like the difference between a UPS Drop-Off Point and a UPS Store Drop-Off. I’ve had to explain this multiple times, and instead of resolving the issue, they just transferred me to someone else who’s equally unhelpful. It’s incredibly frustrating and feels like they don’t value their customers. Amazon, as one of the largest companies in the world, this level of incompetence is unacceptable. It would be best if you prioritized training your staff and fixing this broken return system. Your customers deserve far better than this disrespectful and exhausting experience.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 08, 2024"

"David Irby","Amazon customer service is hit and miss. Often, an agent will lie to you when it comes to refunds. They will tell you the refund has been processed when it hasn't, so you have to go back on the website and repeat the refund request process with another agent, who may also lie to you. On my last experience with Amazon customer service, the first two agents swore that my refund had been processed. I then spoke to a supervisor, who told me that the first agent's request 'glitched' and the second agent's request was never processed. The supervisor then put through the refund request and provided me proof before I would leave the chat. You have to watch these people like a hawk. Always ask for confirmation when Amazon agents tell you that your refund has been processed. (It will show up on your order, but make them show it to you.)","Rated 2 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 02, 2024"

We ordered a bed frame, paid extra to have the bed delivered on a day that was convenient and to also have it put together to save me lots of stress post major surgery. I remained in from 7am -7pm as requested, checked regularly for updates - nothing. 7pm nothing! Contacted Amazon said oh yes we knew there was an issue this morning and no one thought to contact me. Promised a call back from a manager (never happened) and told the item would be delivered the following day and I would receive a phone call the following morning before midday to give me a time for delivery. Made contact with Amazon twice that day and promised on both occasions someone would contact me and that they were going to raise a complaint. More than a week on the beds still not been delivered and we are unable to get a refund! We have spent some much time making calls trying to get our money back - the item hasn’t materialised and that’s not our fault! The advisors have made empty promises and they still have our money having told us we won’t be receiving the item!!! The last customer service advisor was unable to process the refund despite knowing this is the only option. It’s been far more stressful than we ever anticipated. No one wants to respond to my emails, no one contacts us back when promised, raised the issues through the chat function which is useless.

"DMD","WARNING - Delivery Drivers Can Cause Damage To Your Property and Amazon Dont Care! In July this year we received a delivery, nothing unusual, except the courier pushed the parcel through our electric gates rather than bring the parcel to the door. The parcel was relatively small, but when the gates opened as we returned home the master gate was unable to complete its full cycle and it damaged the motor. We had our engineer attend and the motor was clicking every time it went through a cycle. We sent Amazon the call out charge and they put us in contact with Arc their claims handlers (utterly dreadful company) and they agreed to pay the call out charge but wanted to do so in 'full and final settlement'. Given the motor was not still clicking we agreed with our engineers to monitor the motor and of course it has now subsequently failed. With the initial call out, a second to replace the motor and reconfigure it our bill stands at £1101, and now Amazon after six months have decided to pass us to the courier firms insureres to resolve the problem! Sorry not equitable, you are the retailer, my contract is with you and your couriers are your problem!

However, after 9 days, I reached out to inquire about the delivery timeline, and to my surprise, Amazon canceled my order, claiming that the product was no longer available for delivery. This is incredibly frustrating because I was looking forward to receiving the item and now I’m left without a chair, and with no money to buy a replacement since the Black Friday promotion has ended. I feel let down by Amazon’s handling of this situation, and I won’t be able to take advantage of any new deals due to this. This experience has completely ruined my trust in Amazon.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 04, 2024"

"Nemesis","Been using Amazon for nearly 20 years and seen it get worse day by day they are over run by scammer sellers who advertise one product and send a cheaper item/version example i ordered old Jamaica ginger beer original the listing showed images and ingredients of the original i even contacted the seller before buying and they confirmed the original.i ordered and paid and 4 days later i receive the cheaper regular version with sweeteners that tastes absolutely disgusting.i called the seller out who gave me every excuse in the book and Amazon gave me a warning about returns and would not accept a return unless i provide a government form of id.i know my consumer rights in the uk and explained them to Amazon and selling as Amazon uk have to abide by uk trading laws..don't send Amazons third party company your photographed id... i have reported several sellers for sending items not as described or of poor quality even reported listings with all the evidence to support my report and Amazon do nothing.listings are still advertising the wrong items and sellers still allowed while buyers are made to jump through hoops to get their money back. don't believe the reviews either most are for totally different products as plonks who leave reviews don't look at what they are leaving reviews for and look to see if it is a verified purchase and go by that.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 06, 2024"

And when I check my order, the order page show up"" I should update payment method"" I even don't know why. I didn't receive any notice or email or any bank notice. And I do update my payment method twice. it still not works. until I contacted customer service then update my payment method. But the delivery date, always change be late. So, I was contact customer service four time, and they always say waiting 48 hours... so when I wait 48 to 72 hours, I contact customer service again and over again. And one associate told me "" Cancel the item and reorder the item so that the item can be delivered soon"" BUT the page shows up delivery 1/17-1/19 and without any discount. (My order is black Friday deal, like -$140) That's total kidding me... why should I order full price and wait again? If I pay full price, why won't I just go to Apple Store buy it, and I don't need wait again? I believe most people buy on Amazon because they deliver quickly, but if they don't have fast delivery, there is also terrible customer service.

"babablacksheep","I've called my bank they tell me everything's fine. Payment is made. I thought it was weird the money for the order is still in my bank account. Still have not touched that money but payment declines. The thing is I used another card before, my sister's card (because I could order internationally with her card) for the same order on my other account because I couldn't login into my original account because for some weird reason, I couldn't get the sms code to login to my old account. So maybe the bank and amazon think it's fraud. It's not. We all consented to it. She even called the bank for this order and her bank said it was fine. Anyway, same problem. Which is why I tried extra hard to get my old account back and make this order with my renewed debit card. Still this happened to me. So I checked reddit. I found out they only charge when shipment is made. So I have to make sure there's sufficient funds until it is shipped but order still hasn't shipped. Declines even when there's enough funds in bank account. Is it a limit issue? I did not exceed any limit. Now they have to move the arrival date. Again. Guess what? Still not shipped. It's been days. Is this going to happen again? Just charge me immediately once the payment is made.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 09, 2024"

"Chris Karickhoff","I bought two axles as a set from TRQ through Amazon. I only received one. I let both know I did not receive the second axle. TRQ said there was nothing they could do until 30 days had passed and to contact Amazon. Amazon said to contact TRQ. Then Amazon said to return the part. Yeah, that's right, return the good one I got and the one I did not receive. I said I installed the axle on the customers car and bought another from somewhere else to finish the job. I only wanted half my money back. They then proceeded to put me in an infinity loop of idiocy and kept telling me to send in the broken part. They did not listen. When I threatened to report the fraud they deleted the last chat I was having and ghosted me. I told both Amazon and TRQ that I was calling my bank and reporting them and requesting half my money back. As soon as I did that they both emailed to see why. REALLY? I went through all the gyrations again just to be told Amazon could not help me and TRQ said I should have contacted them in less than 30 days so no refunds. They said this on the email chain that showed I did so several times. Unreal. It is a scam by both. All over wanting a $77 refund for a part I never received.

"Beli Sukumaran","Disappointed with the Delivery Process I ordered an expensive item from Amazon expecting their usual prompt service, but this experience has been a disaster. First, it took an unusually long time to arrive. When the delivery finally came, the driver didn’t even bother ringing my doorbell—they just left. When I contacted customer service, they informed me it would take another three days to redeliver, making it 10 days since I placed the order. This is completely unacceptable for a company of Amazon’s size and reputation. They’ve proven to be inefficient and unreliable in delivering important purchases. I expect much better service, especially when paying a premium. Amazon seriously needs to step up its logistics game.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 06, 2024"

I asked them several times and each time they replied with, 'No, it doesn't need returning'. This morning I received an email from Amazon saying they want it back. I contacted Amazon using the chat and not one of the three associates I spoke to understood what I was saying. They were rude, no customer service and had a 'Can't be bothered' attitude. I said I wanted to make a complaint but was told that only they deal with complaints. How can you complain to the very same people you're complaining about(?). I'm so annoyed. All I wanted was to know why I was advised incorrectly and to arrange a collection. What was so difficult for them to understand. Apparently the associates can't access chat history so you need to start again with Evri conversation. They also need the customer to do all the work in finding the order numbers etc and then ask if you're still connected when you're trying to find it!

"Paulette Metoyer","Amazon driver of a blue electric delivery truck entered my driveway past a sign stating ""delivery trucks stop here"" which is in front of a small remote controlled gate. The driver drove over the gate and when driving out carried it under his truck into the street. He was seen doing this by my son in law. He knocked over the bollards marking the edge of the drieway and drove off the driveway and probably hit a tree as I found pieces of his red rear lights along the side of my driveway. I asked Amazon for $129 to purchase a new driveway gate from Amazon. I first spoke to Samad Hussain, then to Divine G, then got a letter from Deb Wentzel, each asking for the same info, which I submitted at least twice. I then got an email stating that they were closing the case. I called back and spoke to Brandon (in South Africa) who listened and said that I had 2 options: I could accept $100 from Amazon with no further questions OR if I wanted more I would still have to submit more infor and more photos, which I could not do as the area has been cleaned up. I told Brandon that I would accept the $100. Then 2 hours later I got an email from Daniel stating that Amazon would not give me the $100 promised unless I send more photos.

I have spent ages trying to find a way of making a complaint about one of their delivery drivers who dropped my delivery over my garden fence and onto my flower bed, rather than using the gate and knocking on the door. Amazon have repeatedly sent me to the seller who did nothing wrong. The delivery was made by Amazon but their ""customer service"" options don't include making a complaint about the delivery. It is worrying that Amazon can set up a service centre that can dictate what they will talk about. As far as I can tell, Amazon have no means for me to tell them about their appalling delivery driver who can carry on with impunity. It's a very short-sighted business practice, but maybe they are too big to worry about their customers' experiences.

Is laughable , seen as they can't progress. This very project was started in part by a software engineer who was frustrated with Amazon's free-shipping offer at the time, which was called Super Saver Shipping. And yes I can understand why he was frustrated because let's face it we are in the future and they still can't get the shipping right, I mean for the very fact that the current Amazon logo depicts the absolute message that they sell everything from A to Z. And they can ship these in good time with subscriptions of prime membership is a joke, they can't communicate on this day in age a delay for a service as a consumer Untill you question this , and their response is to stick as a good will gesture £5 Credit on your account, without asking, yes lack of communication they have the software to do this we are not in 2005 we are almost in 2025 that's 20 years and they still can't get it right , the problem you see lies between that chair and keyboard. I understand that delivery on next day can be up to 10pm but when one order is despatched due say Mon ordered on the sat same day as the order due on sun next and the Sunday one hasn't still being dispatched at 10pm , that is ridiculous.. and then the call/ chat handler on receipt of email sent a email and had chased the wrong order , he chased up Monday's delivery not the one in question. Leaves me to wonder 🤔 if they need to go back to school for basic training and reading of complaints and issues because how can you get it wrong on so many levels , but don't worry I will stick to eBay in the future.

"James Anderson","Amazon's fullfilment and delivery performance has gone straight down the toilet. I've had ongoing problems with items dissappearing in shipping, LONG shiping times (listings don't show origin), incorrect items delivered and deliveries being left on my porch late at night. I had quit using Amazon for a while but decided to give them another chance. My bad. It was a deja-vue experience with the same catagoy of item that never got delivered last year. What is really frustrating is that their website doesn't even have the option to select ""item not delivered"" as the reason for a refund. I had to hunt down a phone number and call to get the matter resolved. To rub salt in the wound, it is going to take 5 to 7 business days for them to refund the money to my Amazon Store Card. Another thing that now irks me about Amazon is that there are a lot of items that you can't purchase unless you subscribe to Amazon Prime. There is ZERO chance that I'm going to pay extra for poor service. I'm not alone in my frustration either. My sister is having the same problems with Amazon that I am. I need to find a replacement item for the one that didn't get delivered (again), but I won't even bother ordering from Amazon. I get MUCH better service from Ebay and their return/refund system is simple and they have better control over where the items ship from.

To contact us about this decision, please email --redacted--."" - Amazon Back about 5 years ago , I purchased a couple security systems from Amazon. Now it's no secret that 100% of these are cheap Chinese garbage security systems. So I had tried a few and returned them until I found one worth keeping (secret: none of them are worth keeping) I ended up leaving reviews for these Chinese security systems, all of them negative, because they are the worst devices in terms of security and I wanted to warn other buyers about them. They all use open WIFI networks, thus turning your wifi into an open network that anyone can use. This brings along with it an issue of not only users using your network for free, but also an attacker could use it to break into your network. They already have access to your network, now all they need to do is break into your PC. These cheap Chinese security cameras have introduced countless vulnerabilities into my network. So I figured I would warn people by leaving a negative review. What happened? Either: - the Chinese seller(s) complained they got a negative review and Amazon banned me - Amazon didn't like the negative review and banned me Personally I think it is the former, the Chinese seller who only wants 5 star reviews complained that they got a 0/1 star review and Amazon banned me. This has an effect of astroturfing the reviews for that seller. Every time they get a negative review the seller flags your account and Amazon bans you from reviews, thus giving them the appearance of having many 5 star reviews and 0 x 0 star reviews. Now you know why Chinese sellers are 5 stars average. Not only that, the sellers ask you to leave 5 star reviews only , and will give a discount in exchange for it, which should be against Amazon's TOS/TOU. Unfortunately (for Amazon) over the past 5-10 years I've purchased over $10,000 worth of products from them. Just this year alone, I've spent between $3,000 and $4,000 and purchased 12 products - none of which are Chinese or came from a Chinese seller. All of them came from Amazon sellers based outside of China. Unfortunately for every non-Chinese seller on Amazon, Amazon has decided to ban me for making a few well deserved negative reviews on cheap Chinese security systems that introduce vulnerabilities to your network. I was going to leave glowing positive reviews for each of the 12 recent purchases, and so I contacted Amazon to return my ability to write reviews because I have good reviews to leave, and customers should not be banned simply for leaving a negative review. Unfortunately again for Amazon, they have decided to keep my account banned even though that Chinese seller probably no longer exists and has changed their name to get away from negative reviews like they always do. The end result is not only Amazon suffers by losing 12 glowing positive reviews to protect a Chinese seller selling garbage with holes throughout. But also the consumer loses out, by not having accurate reviews to base their purchase decision off of. TLDR; Amazon is astroturfing reviews for Chinese sellers, and if you leave a negative review you are risking being banned like I am. Also note they are astroturfing the subreddit r/Amazon as my postings are removed almost immediately. I've bought many amazing products from Amazon, and so this only hurts Amazon and it's consumers. Now at least 12 sellers are missing 5 star positive reviews that they've earned the hard way. Trustpilot: Why can't I put less than or greater than? Wtf? Also a rich text input box would be nice ...","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: November 27, 2024"

"Jules 1888","I'm frustrated at how Amazon has become a site for people selling fakes! Last year, my friend in a different part of the UK and I both had the same duck advent calendar from Amazon, his was gifted to him by someone else and as we both started opening the calendars it became clear that the items inside did not match the imagery on the listings! Many identical small yellow ducks that got tedious to find in the calendar. This year I was pleased to see a national lampoons calendar which I purchased and put away for Dec, the contents had been disappointing and today on day 5 there wasn't an item behind the door! I take the inside of the calendar out and it's all tiny bits of plastic tat! Not the national lampoons figures as shown on the image! I looked at reviews on all these listings for the calendar and it was the same story, people with very disappointed children left with calendars that don't feel worth opening now! People had to open them to try and find out why windows had nothing in them. What makes me laugh is you get fake reviews thrown into the mix! Ridiculously rave reviews showing a real calendar image that's supposed to be theirs and they post the reviews in September? Who started opening advent calendars in September? The seller came back surprisingly quick and agreed to a refund but I find that about Chinese rip offs, there's that many they get away with not refunding that it's still cost effective to sell fake tat and refund the few that do ask for one. I turned more to Amazon because eBay stopped being trustworthy because of the amount of really poor Chinese scams on there, you need to deal with this Amazon! If the seller didn't refund me, I would certainly expect Amazon to because their site shows fake images on listings!","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 05, 2024"

"E B","Do not order Cheez it's crackers via Amazon.com , you may be disappointed when you find nothing but crumbs in the box, not to mention if you purchase the party size box, that too many disappoint you as it is not the same party size you may be used to . The party size box via Amazon is not equivalent to the box you would purchase at Sam's club . Amazon is smaller in everything ! I made a mistake by ordering shelf stable items which seemed to be the same as the local grocery store but nope! Everything was small sizes. Never again, I deleted my Amazon account because I'm sick of Amazon and the bad business practices . The box of Cheez it's is only one of many reasons I hate Amazon. Under an item it says when you will receive the item, then after finalizing payment, the date changes to a month or so later. If you are not satisfied with the new date you then have to go through customer service then still you either just wait for it or cancel it. I also have a gut feeling that my account has not been deleted as per my request, but so what I am never going to use it again and I will monitor my cards to be certain there are no surprise charges such as Amazon prime. Just be aware that boxed food products are either mishandled or straight up old due to the crumbs being the majority of the contents. Amazon says I'm not eligible to leave a product review but I was eligible to waste my money. Also the fact that I cannot even leave a review on Google regarding my Amazon purchase is BS!!!","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: October 16, 2024"

"Eliana Ruiz","Well, I had a BIG issue with amazon. i’ve been contacting them for the last 4 days and imagine wake up every morning to talk to agents and go over the same story about 15 times. Exhausted. There seemed to be a problem regarding my payment method and they told me the problem was me. I talked to my bank and they told me by the fraud department that amazon team were placing an order with a different billing address. To resume this 4 days of calls. Some of the agents i talked with were rude, not working by the hand with the guest, just excuses, and clearly not willing to work at all, whit a big lack of communication and procedures. Transferred me to wrong departments, keep me in a ping pong game, denied me talking to an aupervisor etc. The only time they tried to charge me was the 1st of december, (i placed the order on the 11/27) the past days i’ve talked with MANY different agents, multiple times a day and they promised me they proceed the payment. Which was fake. Until today, after 4 days i talked with an agent that it’s truly an agent and really deserves to be recognized for his great work. He absolutely helped me and not just with words, facts in here. I’m leaving the country in 4 days so this has been a big problem for many reasons. And also my first time ordering with amazon. I just want to thank Eddy who was the ONLY agent to care about me and my concern in the best way possible. Super patience, kind, respectful, he truly deserves to be part of this team, give him a raise!!! Thank you Eddy i’ll be always thankful with you.

"Brygida","I am extremely disappointed with Amazon lately. I have been Prime member for years and would order many items as it was always convenient and easy with next day delivery. Unfortunately since RM is being used everything has gone downhill. The tracking is awful and details never updated. Prime deliveries take 3-5 days! This is shocking and definitely puts me off buying from Amazon. If I have to wait this long for a product why bother ordering from Amazon,I may aswell buy elsewhere. RM is the least reliable delivery company in the UK and to see Amazon using them is a BAD decision for their business. I've recently ordered something on Amazon through Prime as I thought it would come the next day, then I've noticed the delivery changed to be expected 3 days later. The tracking number provided said that RM is expecting the parcel, but Amazon status said it has been despatched. On the day of expected delivery Amazon update showed expected by 8pm BUT RM still had no update on the tracking page and it still claimed ""awaiting parcel"" so this got me worried and I knew something isn't right. Finally, 8pm has passed and no parcel arrived, Amazon status change to ""now expected 3 days layer"" which means this would make nearly 7 days for delivery. I've contacted RM the next say and been told the seller still hasn't shipped the item so they are awaiting it. I have contacted Amazon and requested to cancel the order and contacted the seller to request stop and not dispatch the product anymore as I went elsewhere. No response from the seller but I thought I've done my part. Amazon said they have stopped the order. The next day, the parcel was delivered to my neighbour!! Otherwise I wouldn't accept it! Contacting Amazon / seller again to explain I don't want it anymore and I need to return. They send me a return label which I had to pay for!!! Contacted them to say I am not playing for this return. Finally got the pre-paid return label. Now I can't see any more updates on RM as to where the parcel is and if it has been delivered! I can only see it has been accepted by RM when I dropped it off, few days later (4) still no update so I am now worried about my refund £799!!! Refund is not done automatically now with Amazon! You have to go to the item you've returned and request a refund which then takes up to 7 days! I am so disappointed Amazon is no longer the same, it's a real shame!","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: November 28, 2024"
"Barrie Smith","My first complaint over this delivery was....."" Flashforge Adventurer 5M Pro 3D Printer I purchase from you at £399 little did I know that it would be up to me to deliver it myself. the delivery man came and I saw the delivery man arrive and carry this item to my building and I waited him to call on the intercom but after a while realised that he was not going to.I have Asperger's,osteoarthritis an a heart condition and am 73 years old. I saw him leaving and putting my parcel back in the van, I shouted to him ""do you have a parcel for flat 78 ?"" He replied ""yes but there was no reply on the intercom"" I told him that he needed to press 178 and I would buzz him in but he said ""no I have other delivery s now"" I told him that I would complain and he said ""Okay but you have to come down and get it. This is an item that I cannot even lift and told him about my age and that I was disabled and he needed to bring it up to me.But he refused and made me go down two floors and along the corridor to the main entrance. I opened the door and told him that I would complain and he told me it was my fault not his. I explained that in my delivery instructions it even says come down the path to the left the dial ""178"" into the key panel,but he kept telling me it was my fault even though I showed him by the keypad that it said put a 1 before the flat numbers. I was very angry. He then said he needed the security passcode which I then gave him. He the said he needed to scan the the barcode. Followed by ""now there's no signal"". He would not bring it up for me and left. Then I had to drag it along the corridor to the lift then up two floors and then drag it to me flat which is at the end of that corridor. I then had to go and take some lorazepam to calm down. I phone amazon to complain and a nice lady with a strong accent offered me £10 compensation after I requested some after continually have these problems with the company. I consider this an insult. Is this really all my time and stress is worth. I am sick of your company. Ali Express seems to get everything here with no issues. Time and again I need to complain and you keep thinking you can weasel out of this with a maximum compensation of £30. Not this time enough is enough. You have to do better than that. You treat us all like cattle fodder no clients. Rev.Barrie Smith."" Then it turned out that after a week the nozzle became faulty. Rather than making Amazon go to the expense of coming and getting the machine then having to send out another one I phone customer services and told them that the nozzle was faulty and could I get the NOZZLE replaced and the lady said ""we would like to put £50 on your gift card as a good will gesture"". And if you listen to the phone call you will hear me say "" this £50 has nothing to do with my complaint about the delivery does it?"" And she replied ""No it has nothing to do with your complaint"". So I accepted and as soon as it was in my account I ordered a new nozzle with that money. Since then Amazon has on two occasions offered a full refund of £399. But being an honest person I pointed out that I had after problems with the delivery and dragging the 20KG machine to my flat I did have the item. Then its "" Oh no you have had £50 that's all we can offer"". Your company is disgraceful. Over the years I have purchase 10 of thousands of pounds worth of products from you but have had continual problems with delivery s because the delivery people cannot read English or don't have enough time to deliver. To my knowledge some delivery people just dump delivery s in fields. I have Asperger's,a heart issue and osteoarthritis. But you are happy to make me stay in for three days now waiting for phone calls that you email me will come that day but never come. You don't give shit about my health or customer relations. I should have kept my mouth shut and taken the £399 refund but unfortunately my morals are at a much higher level than yours.","Rated 1 out of 5 stars","Date of experience: December 08, 2024"

"Big-G","My Experience with Amazon UK, Reliant, and ArrowXL (Part 2): Accountability and Responsibility Failures This is a critical review of my recent purchase of a TV via Amazon UK, highlighting serious accountability and responsibility failures involving Amazon, Reliant (seller), and ArrowXL (courier). The experience has caused emotional distress, financial strain, and logistical inconvenience, especially since this purchase was intended as a Christmas gift. The Issue 27th November: I ordered a TV sold by Reliant via Amazon, with delivery promised by 30th November. 30th November: Delivery missed, and the date was pushed to 3rd December, but it still did not arrive. 3rd December: Amazon informed me the TV was ""likely lost"", while ArrowXL confirmed they never received the item. 3rd December: Despite this, £888 was debited from my Barclays bank account via direct debit — not credit card — contrary to Amazon’s claim that ""payment authorization was incomplete."" Failures of Accountability Amazon's Role False Claims: On 3rd December, Amazon falsely claimed that payment was ""pending"" and authorization was incomplete, yet the payment had been successfully debited from my Barclays account. Broken Promises: On 3rd December, Amazon promised in writing to issue a refund within 24 hours, but this was not done. The refund deadline was later shifted to 13th December, despite evidence the item was lost. Failure to Escalate: Amazon failed to resolve the issue with Reliant or ArrowXL, forcing me to pursue direct contact with the seller. Reliant (The Seller) Failure to Dispatch: Reliant failed to release the TV to ArrowXL. Reliant’s system shows the order as ""pending"", confirming that the item was never released to the courier. No Transparency: Reliant only responded after I contacted them via customer service email and left a review on Trustpilot. Payment Issue: Reliant provided Amazon's message, which incorrectly claimed that payment authorization was incomplete. This was factually incorrect, as the payment of £888 was debited on 3rd December. ArrowXL (The Courier) No Custody of the TV: ArrowXL confirmed they never received the TV, and since Reliant’s system shows the order as ""pending"", it’s clear that ArrowXL is not at fault in this case. No Proactive Updates: Despite being the assigned courier, ArrowXL failed to communicate the non-receipt of the package proactively. Accountability Failures False Payment Claims: Reliant and Amazon falsely claimed payment authorization was incomplete, despite the payment being successfully debited from my account on 3rd December. False Delivery Claims: The TV was listed as ""damaged in transit"" (according to Amazon) and ""pending dispatch"" (according to Reliant), while ArrowXL confirmed it was never received. Broken Refund Promises: Amazon promised a refund within 24 hours on 3rd December, but then delayed it to 13th December, despite clear evidence that the TV was not dispatched. Impact on Me as a Customer Emotional Distress The TV was a Christmas gift, and as we approach Christmas, the chance of finding a replacement is rapidly decreasing. This has caused emotional stress, especially since delays are likely to increase as Christmas approaches. Financial Strain £888 was debited from my bank account on 3rd December, but no refund has been issued. This financial strain has limited my ability to purchase a replacement gift. Breach of Trust Amazon provided a written assurance of a refund to be processed within 24 hours, but this was not honored. This has eroded my trust in Amazon, Reliant, and ArrowXL. Consumer Rights Violations Failure to Deliver Goods Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the seller (Reliant) is responsible for ensuring delivery. As Reliant never released the TV to the courier, this is a clear breach of their legal obligation. Withholding Refunds Without Justification Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, refunds must be issued without undue delay. The delay until 13th December is unlawful since the TV was never dispatched. Breach of Written Assurance On 3rd December, Amazon provided written assurance that a refund would be processed within 24 hours, which was not done. This constitutes a potential breach of obligations under the Misrepresentation Act 1967. Final Thoughts This experience demonstrates a complete failure of accountability from Amazon, Reliant, and ArrowXL. Reliant failed to release the TV for dispatch. Amazon falsely claimed payment authorization was incomplete, even though £888 was debited on 3rd December. Amazon broke its written promise of a refund within 24 hours.
